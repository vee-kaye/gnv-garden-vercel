The Battle of Gainesville occurred on August 17, [[1864\|1864]] after Colonel Andrew L. Harris and his army of 173 men destroyed a fortified picket post on the [[New River\|New River]]. They advanced to [[Starke\|Starke]], were they were joined by additional Union troops, bringing the total command to 310 men. 

The first leg of the battle was brief; Harris's men came upon 70 Confederate soldiers when they entered Gainesville, and quickly overpowered them. Shortly after, though, additional Confederate troops, headed by Captain [[J.J. Dickinson\|J.J. Dickinson]], AKA the "Swamp Fox", arrived from [[Waldo\|Waldo]]. Dickinson had fewer than 300 men, but, after two hours of battle, Harris retreated. After taking a wrong turn, the Union soldiers were captured. 

28 Union soldiers were killed, 5 were wounded, and 188 were captured. Only one Confederate soldier was killed, and 5 of theirs were wounded.[^1]

The victory may have come down to the fact that Union soldiers were spread throughout the city; it's said that Union troops were scattered around town looting when Confedeate soldiers arrived[^2]
