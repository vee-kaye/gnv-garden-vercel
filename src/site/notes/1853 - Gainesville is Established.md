Plans for the [[1859 - The Florida Railroad Comes to Gainesville\|Florida Railroad]] were revealed in 1850, showing that the new cross-state railway would bypass the Alachua County seat in [[first drafts/Newnansville\|Newnansville]][^1]. On September 6, 1853, it was decided at a meeting at [[Boulware Springs\|Boulware Springs]] to move the seat closer to the railroad and to create a new town[^2]. 

Sixty-three acres of property were purchased by the county from Major James B. Bailey on January 24, 1854 for $242.52. It wasn't until September 6 of that year that the Alachua County Commissioners named the town (Past Prologue):

>"A square to be reserved in the center, as near as may be, containing four acres, four main streets entering the square to be 90 feet wide. The other Streets to be 40 feet wide. The entire Town to be surrounded by a Street not less than thirty feet. The place to be named Gainsville."
