>a place in said county usually called and known, as the courthouse head, eight miles southeast of the Natural Bridge on the Santa Fe River, and on United State's road, known as Bellamys' Road ... That said county site shall hereafter be called and known by the name [[first drafts/Newnansville\|Newnansville]].[^1]
