Negotiations between Spain and the United States began in 1819 and the Adams-Onis (or Transcontinental) Treaty was ratified in 1821; the colonies of East Florida and West Florida were combined into a single territory with "twin capitals" at [[Pensacola\|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine\|St. Augustine]][^1]. 

Andrew Jackson was appointed the governor of Florida under Jackson's condition that he would be allowed to resign as soon as "the territorial government was organized"[^2]. Jackson visited Florida once during the War of 1812, once during the First Seminole War, and once to organize the government in 1821; he did not return after.
