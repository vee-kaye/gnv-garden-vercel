Gainesville's streets are built on a grid with four quadrants: Northwest, Northeast, Southwest, and Southeast. The prefix for a street determines it quadrant and the boundaries of these quadrants are created by [[University Avenue\|University Avenue]] and [[Main Street\|Main Street]], the intersection of which marks the center of the grid. 

University Avenue runs east-to-west, along with all other Avenues, Places, Roads, and Lanes. Main Street runs north-to-south, along with all other Streets, Terraces, Driver, Circles, and Courts. You can remember this with the (admittedly outdated) acronym APRL has STDs. 

So, for example, if an address is located on NW 10th Avenue, using the NW prefix and the "Avenue" suffix, we know that this address is in the *northwest* quadrant of the city, north of University and west of Main, and will run *parallel* to University Avenue -- since its an avenue, which will also run east-to-west. 

Likewise, if an address is on SE 2nd Terrace, we know that this is in the *southeast* quadrant of the city, south of University and east of Main, and will run *parallel* to Main Street -- since its a *terrace*, which runs east-to-west like streets. 

The quadrants are not the only tools in the grid system. Address numbers are also standardized, in most cases. 

The address or house number will usually have 3-4 digits; the fist 1-2 digits indicate which *block* an address is in and the final two digits indicate *where* within in that block an address is located. 

For example, if you are looking for 1225 NW 10th Avenue, this address is in the 1200 block of NW 10th Ave., meaning that it's going to be between 12th Street and 13th Street. If you are driving west on 10th Ave. and cross 13th St., you've gone too far; similarly, if you are driving *east* on 10th Ave. and cross 12th. street, you've gone too far. 

The last two digits in that same example -- 25 -- indicates that, within the 1200 block, the address is *closer* to the center of town than other addresses on 10th Ave.; in this case, that means it's closer to 12th St. than to 13th St. 

You won't always know this without comparing other addresses along the same block; for example, some streets may have addresses with final digits that range from 00 - 25, where 25 (being the highest) is *further* from the center of town. However, if you are driving west on 10th Ave. and see address numbers ending in something *higher* than 25, you can know you've gone too far. 

The final digit in an address number tells you even more about the address's location. If the final digit is *even*, it will be on the north or west side of the road; if the final digit is *odd*, it will be on the south or east side of the road. 

In our 1225 NW 10th Avenue example, the final digit in the building number is odd. Since we're traveling east-to-west, we're looking for the *south* side of the road. 

The final pieces to the puzzle aren't quite as standardized, but can be helpful to know. 

First, all types of streets typically follow the same pattern as in the acronym within a *block*, which is defined by the Street or Avenue. That is, if you see a 6th Avenue, you may then see a 6th Place, then a 6th Road, then a 6th Lane -- all of these streets until 5th Ave. moving south or 7th Ave. moving north make up the 600 *block* of the street you're driving down. Likewise, if you see a 5th Street, it may be followed by a 5th Terrace and then a 5th Drive, and so on, all making up the 500 *block* of the Avenue, Place, Road, or Lane you're driving down. 

Second, each of the primary blocks is typically about 1/10th of a mile, so an address can also give you an estimate of how far an address is from the center of town. So, sticking with our 1225 NW 10th Ave. example, you'll remember that the 12 in the address number tells us that it's in the 1200 block, or close to NW 12th. *Street* when you're on 10th Ave. In other words, 12 blocks west of Main Street, or 1.2 miles away. The NW10th Avenue part of the address tells us that it's 10 blocks north of University Avenue, or about one mile. All of this means that, if you are starting from the intersection of Main Street and University, 1225 NW 10th Avenue is approximately 2.2 miles away. This is *not* exact, especially as more roads and shortcuts are added -- this address is more like 1.4 miles away in reality -- but it can still be useful in gauging distance. 

## Examples

#### [[Ward's Supermarket\|Ward's Supermarket]], 515 NW 23rd Avenue
Ward's is located in the Northwest quadrant of the city in the 500 block of NW 23rd Avenue. It is 23 blocks (or about 2.3 miles) *north* of University Avenue and about 5 blocks (half a mile) *west* of Main Street. If you are driving east on NW 23rd Ave. and hit 6th Street, you've gone too far; if you are driving west and hit 4th Street, you've gone too far. Since its address ends in a 5, the building is on the south side of the road. 

#### [[Civic Media Cente\|Civic Media Cente]]r, 433 S. Main Street
The CMC is located *on* Main Street; since it's on South Main, we know that it is *south* of University Avenue. Since its in the 400 block, we know it's approximately four blocks south of University. And since its adress ends in an odd number, it is on the east side of the road.
