Construction of Florida's cross-state railroad, led by [[David Yulee\|David Yulee]], began in [[1855\|1855]] and ran from [[Amelia Island\|Amelia Island]] to [[Cedar Key\|Cedar Key]]. The land in Florida at the time was "sandy, swampy and nearly impassible"[^1] and it took nearly a year to complete the first ten miles of the track[^2]

The railroad entered modern-day Gainesville on February 1, [[1859\|1859]] and ran along what is now [[Waldo Road\|Waldo Road]], crossing [[13th St.\|13th St.]] at [[Archer Road\|Archer Road]]. It was completed in [[1861\|1861]], officially connecting the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, allowing ships to bypass the [[Florida Keys\|Florida Keys]], "an area where ship sinking annual loses [sic] reached millions of dollars" (FRRM). 

The route of the railroad bypassed the county seat of [[Newnansville\|Newnansville]] so, prior to construction even beginning, it was decided on September 6, [[1853\|1853]] at a [[Boulware Springs\|Boulware Springs]] meeting to move the seat closer to the railroad and to create a new town: Gainesville[^3].
