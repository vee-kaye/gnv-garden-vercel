Construction of Florida's cross-state railroad, led by David Yulee, began in 1855 and ran from Amelia Island in Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key. The land in Florida at the time is said to have been "sandy, swampy and nearly impassible"[^1] and it took nearly a year to complete the first ten miles of the track[^2].

The railroad entered Gainesville on February 1, 1859 and ran along what is now Waldo Road, crossing 13th Street at Archer Road. It was completed in 1861, officially connecting the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, allowing ships to bypass the Florida Keys, "an area where ship sinking annual loses [sic] reach millions of dollars" (FRRM). 

The route of the railroad bypassed the original county seat of [[first drafts/Newnansville\|Newnansville]], so, prior to construction even beginning, [[1853 - Gainesville is Established\|Gainesville was established]] to be the home of a new county seat[^3].
