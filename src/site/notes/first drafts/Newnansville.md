Newnansville, named for Patriot War Colonel Daniel Newnan, is the settlement which held the first county seat upon the [[1824 - Alachua County is Established\|creation of Alachua County]]. The settlement was near Dell's P.O, a post office established in 1826 and became the "junction of several important trails through Frontier Florida"[^1]. 

The [[1859 - The Florida Railroad Comes to Gainesville\|Florida Railroad]] bypassing Newnansville -- and the [[1853 - Gainesville is Established\|establishment of Gainesville as the county seat]] -- led to the slow decline of Newnansville. According to Explore Historic Alachua County:

>The community was dealt a final blow in 1884 when the Savannah, Florida and Western Railroad bypassed it. A new town, Alachua, grew up near that railroad. As the years passed, the residents of Newnansville moved there or elsewhere. By the 1970’s only a few traces remained of the former community.
