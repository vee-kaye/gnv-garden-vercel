In [[1824\|1824]], the territorial legislature created [[Alachua County\|Alachua County]], an area that stretched from the Georgia boarder to [[Tampa Bay\|Tampa Bay]][^1]. 

According to [[Pam Marlin\|Pam Marlin]][^2], after the county was created, local leaders decided to establish a new county seat on November 15, [[1828\|1828]], naming:

>a place in said county usually called and known, as the courthouse head, eight miles southeast of the Natural Bridge on the Santa Fe River, and on United State's road, known as Bellamys' Road ... That said county site shall hereafter be called and known by the name [[Newnansville\|Newnansville]].

This county seat would be moved to Gainesville following the [[Opening of the Florida Railroad\|openining of the Florida Railroad]].
